# OpenSpec documentation awareness

- When working on OpenSpec (opsx) changes or using OpenSpec skills/commands, always read and consider the documentation files provided or referenced by the change (proposal/specs/notes/etc.) and any docs explicitly given by the user, by default being: /docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, /docs/STACK.md, /docs/starting-points/INTIAL_REQ.md, and /docs/starting-points/SHOWCASE.md
- Treat those docs as the source of truth for requirements; if they conflict, call it out and follow the most recent change artifact unless instructed otherwise.
- Do not implement or answer OpenSpec work without checking the relevant docs first.
