## 1. Angular app scaffold

- [x] 1.1 Create Angular app in `frontend/` with project name pitch-shifter-demo-frontend (use Angular CLI; keep app at `frontend/` e.g. with `--directory .`)
- [x] 1.2 Add Angular Material to the project and configure (e.g. `ng add @angular/material`)
- [x] 1.3 Verify `angular.json` (or equivalent) identifies the project as pitch-shifter-demo-frontend and production build outputs static assets (e.g. to `dist/`)

## 2. Hello world view

- [x] 2.1 Implement a minimal "Hello world" (or equivalent) view as the default route
- [x] 2.2 Use at least one Angular Material component on that view (e.g. toolbar, card, or button)
- [x] 2.3 Run production build and confirm static output; run app locally to verify the hello-world page loads

## 3. Deployment walkthrough document

- [x] 3.1 Create deployment walkthrough document (e.g. `docs/azure-frontend-deploy.md` or `frontend/DEPLOY.md`)
- [x] 3.2 Document prerequisites (Node/npm version, Azure CLI or portal, accounts/subscriptions)
- [x] 3.3 Document Azure service setup (e.g. Static Web Apps or App Service) and build/deploy steps so the app is reachable in Azure
- [x] 3.4 Document any required configuration (build output path, app settings, deployment source)
- [x] 3.5 Ensure the document is findable (e.g. link from `frontend/README.md` or repo root README if applicable)
