## Why

New contributors need a clear, repeatable setup path for the Angular/.NET stack. Documenting required tools and providing a bootstrap script reduces onboarding time and avoids environment drift.

## What Changes

- Add developer setup documentation that lists every required tool/SDK/framework and explains its purpose.
- Provide a script that checks for required dependencies and installs missing ones for a smooth first-run experience.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `dev-environment-docs`: A comprehensive setup guide that enumerates required tooling and explains what each is used for.
- `dev-environment-bootstrap`: A cross-platform-friendly script to detect and install required tools for this project.

### Modified Capabilities
- (none)

## Impact

- Adds new documentation and a setup script to the repo.
- Impacts developer onboarding and local environment configuration.
