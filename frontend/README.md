# Frontend (Angular)

This folder will host the Angular client for the pitch-shifter demo.

## Scope
- Angular + TypeScript UI for playback, pitch/tempo controls, and track selection.
- Web Audio API (`AudioContext`, `AnalyserNode`) for real-time analysis.
- Canvas-based waveform rendering for original vs processed audio.

## Notes
- The API base URL will be configured once the backend is scaffolded.
